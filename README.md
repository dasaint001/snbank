This is a basic banking system set up for staffs with registered user details on the platform. 
Firstly, registered staff is allowed to log in with his/her user details after which an access to options of creating a new bank account, checking account details and logging out is granted. There is a text file (staff.txt) containing the details of staff given the access to the banking system.
Secondly, depending on the choice of the staff, he/she is prompted to fill required form with details such as account name, opening balance, account type and account email.
The details entered are stored in a text file named customer.txt and a unique account number is automatically generated for any bank account created. 
Only two staffs presently have access to this banking system.
Username(password) are dasaint(123456) and temidee(667755).
